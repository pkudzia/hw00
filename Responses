# Question 4
First rewrite the pendulum equation in terms of theta’’ = wn^2*theta.  
To simulate this second-order differential equation we need to convert it to a series of first order equations. 
To do this we re-write out the vector, lets call it x, which has two components :
{ x1 = theta  , x2 =theta’ } 
next we write out the derivatives of those :
{d/dt x1 = x2 , d/dt x2 = wn^2*x1}
We would then be able to set up the ode45 solver and make wn variable that is equal to 1 and solve our ODE. 

# Question 5
We can simulate this initial value problem (IVP) similarly as noted above. Since it is a first order we write series of equations which could simply too 
{d/dt x1 = -y(1)} in the @f of the ode solverer.
Would wiykd then run it from a starting condition of x0 =1 over a defined tspan. To solve the IVP. 

# Question 6
Manoj once told me that event detection is not the ‘best' approach in ODE simulation. I forget exactly why but I think he meant that the approach isn’t robust.  Can anyone comment on this or has experiences that can speak to this ?
